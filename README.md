# Tic-Tac-Toe-board

The main function contains the game logic. It initializes the Tic-Tac-Toe board, takes turns from players ('X' and 'O'), validates moves, checks for a win or a tie, and prints the board at each step. The game continues until a player wins or the board is full.

Nested Functions: The main function calls the printBoard, checkWin, and isBoardFull functions.
Game Loop: The game is implemented as a do-while loop that continues until a break statement is encountered.
This code provides a console-based implementation of a two-player Tic-Tac-Toe game. Players take turns entering their moves, and the game checks for a winner or a tie after each move. The board is displayed after each turn, and the game results are printed at the end.
